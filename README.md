# Zachery Linscott's CS476 Project 2

## Project input files:

Location:
- The project input files are in the project's top level directory.

Names:
- `DM-p127.txt`, `DM-p139.txt`, and `Mammal-DM.txt` (which is from the quiz-test).

## Project executable scripts:

Location: 
- The executables are in the top level of the project directory.

Names:
- `upgma.py` and `neighborjoin.py`

**Don't** run `helpers.py` (pls)

## How to run the UPGMA algorithm:

1. In a shell of your choice (e.g. Bash, Zsh, Powershell), run: `python upgma.py` or `python3 upgma.py`, depending on your version of python.
2. Enter the desired input matrix file name e.g. `DM-p139.txt`. It is best that the file is within the project directory. If it is not, type the full path to the file.
3. Evaluate the output.

## How to run the Neighbor Join algorithm:
1. In a shell of your choice (e.g. Bash, Zsh, Powershell), run: `python neighborjoin.py` or `python3 neighborjoin.py`, depending on your version of python.
2. Enter the desired input matrix file name e.g. `DM-p127.txt`. It is best that the file is within the project directory. If it is not, type the full path to the file.
3. Evaluate the output.



### The way to execute both programs is virtually identical.

If you need to execute on the home server, these commands will work perfectly fine as long as you have Python downloaded.
